# 🎵 PomoPlayer

> Because remembering to start both your timer AND your music shouldn't require two brain cells.

## What's This All About?

Ever found yourself 20 minutes into what you *thought* was a Pomodoro session, only to realize you never actually started the timer? Or worse, came back from a "quick" bathroom break to find your timer's been paused for... *checks watch*... 2 hours? 

Yeah, me too. That's why I built PomoPlayer! 

## ✨ Features That Make Life Less Chaotic

- **Auto-sync Music & Timer**: One button to rule them all! Start your timer, and your YouTube music starts too. Magic! 🪄
- **Pause Reminders**: A gentle "hey, you still alive?" notification when you forget to unpause
- **YouTube Integration**: Because switching between 17 different tabs is *so* 2023
- **Mini Player Mode**: For when you want your music controls but don't need the whole video taking up precious screen real estate
- **Customizable Sessions**: Work/break durations that fit YOUR schedule (we don't judge if your "quick break" is longer than your work session)
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Because your eyes deserve better than being burned at 3 AM
- **Local Storage**: Your settings persist between sessions (unlike your productivity goals)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install` (or `yarn install` if you're fancy)
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Actually remember to start studying this time

## 💭 Why Does This Exist?

Because I kept forgetting to:
1. Start my timer
2. Start my music
3. Unpause after breaks
4. Actually study (this one's still a work in progress...)

## 🛠️ Built With

- Next.js (because regular React wasn't complicated enough)
- TypeScript (for when you want your compiler to judge your life choices)
- TailwindCSS (because writing actual CSS is so 2010)
- YouTube API (thanks, Google!)
- Love and Procrastination (mostly procrastination)
